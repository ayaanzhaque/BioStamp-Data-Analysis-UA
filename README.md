# BioStamp-Data-Analysis-UA

Interned at the Sarver Heart Center at the University of Arizona in July 2019 on motion sensing devices. I interned for Yoni Weiner (under the supervision of Dr. Kaitlyn Ammannon) analysis of data that he collected with the BioStamp. I used R and JMP to analyze data and make charts and graphs, and helped with the visualization and analysis part of the project. All of the data is collected by Yoni Weiner, and we worked together to analyze the data.
