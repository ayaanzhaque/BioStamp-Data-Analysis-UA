# BioStamp-Data-Analysis-UA

Interned at the Sarver Heart Center at the University of Arizona in July 2019 on motion sensing devices. I interned for Yoni Weiner (under the supervision of Dr. Kaitlyn Ammannon) analysis of data that he collected with the BioStamp, a wearable medical device used to track movement in patients. I used R and JMP to analyze data and make charts and graphs, and helped with the visualization and analysis part of the project. We analyzed data from different tests, such as squeezing differnet sized balls as a side project. The main goal was to allow for quantitative assesments of CPR. All of the data is collected by Yoni Weiner, and we worked together to analyze the data.
